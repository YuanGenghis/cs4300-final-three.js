So for now, our heroku doesn't work, so need to download the project and run in local right now. 
After downloading, cd into the project
1. First install npm and node, 
2. Run $node server.js   
3. Go to localhost:3000
Then you can see the project

WARNING!!!
If you have a touch screen on your laptop. Please use the touch screen on delete button. 
Otherwise, you may need to try a lot of times on delete button.
In my laptop, I need to click like 30-40 times then on delete, but if I click by using touch screen, it works very well.
